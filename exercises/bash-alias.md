## Create a Bash Alias

**15 min**

Let's get some practice with modifying our `.bash_profile` by creating some useful command aliases.

- Create an alias so that anywhere in the terminal you can type `class` and it will automatically `cd` into your WDI code directory
- Create an alias to `cd` directly into a projects directory inside of your WDI code folder

### Tips

- Open up your `.bash_profile` in the editor by typing the command `atom ~/.bash_profile`
- Remember that you can create an alias for any command by following the format: `alias [alias_name]="[command_to_run]"`
- Anytime you modify the `.bash_profile`, you need to remember to either `source ~/.bash_profile` the file or run the command `reload` for the new changes to take effect
